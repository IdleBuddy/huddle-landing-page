## My process

I wanted something a little bit easier this time. Using basic flexbox structure the website.

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Flexbox
- Desktop Workflow First

### What I learned
 
 I've learned to better control how flexbox shrinks and grows in order to make responsive websites. I still don't understand the concept fully and want to keep working with it to make it flow more smoothly.
